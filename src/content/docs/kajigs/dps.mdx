#### Requirements:
Access to `chrome://serviceworker-internals`, and inspect element ***disabled***

#### Steps:
1. Go to `chrome://serviceworker-internals`.
2. Click the checkbox that says `Open DevTools and pause JavaScript execution on Service Worker startup for debugging`
3. Find the extension you want to disabled
4. Click stop if it appears (otherwise, skip this step)
5. Click unregister

Works on: Blockfiletypes, LanSchool, GoGuardian, and likely several other untested extensions.
