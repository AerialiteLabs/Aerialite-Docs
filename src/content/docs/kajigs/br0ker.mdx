It requires you to be on v132 or lower, which can be achieved by downgrading to v132 LTS. You can also get the bundled update with Sh1mmer, by building with it's [update payload](/kajigs/sh1mmer#update-payload)

### How do I use Br0ker?
Sh1mmer only:
    1. Boot [Sh1mmer](/kajigs/sh1mmer), and use the Br0ker payload.

BadApple + Sh1mmer:
    1. Enter [BadApple](/kajigs/badapple)
    2. Plug in your Sh1mmer USB drive
    3. Find your USB device by running
        ```
        ls /dev/sd*
        ```
        and noting what shows up. (we'll use /dev/sdX as an example, replace it with your device.)
    4. Run these commands:
        ```
        mkdir -p /mnt/sh1mmer
        mount -o ro /dev/sdX /mnt/sh1mmer
        sh /mnt/sh1mmer/root/noarch/payloads/br0ker.sh
        ```

Sh1ttyOOBE + BadRecovery + Sh1mmer (v135-137)
    1. Perform [Sh1ttyOOBE](/kajigs/sh1ttyoobe), press [Esc+Ref+Pwr], and enter developer mode
    2. Enter unverified [BadRecovery](/kajigs/badrecovery), ignore errors, and wait for the shell.
    3. Once it fully loads, unplug the USB drive used for BadRecovery
    4. Plug in your Sh1mmer USB drive
    5. Find your USB device by running
        ```
        ls /dev/sd*
        ```
        and noting what shows up. (we'll use /dev/sdX as an example, replace it with your device.)
    6. Run these commands:
        ```
        mkdir -p /mnt/sh1mmer
        mount -o ro /dev/sdX /mnt/sh1mmer
        sh /mnt/sh1mmer/root/noarch/payloads/br0ker.sh
        ```

Sh1ttyOOBE + BadBr0ker (v135-137)
    1. Perform [Sh1ttyOOBE](/kajigs/sh1ttyoobe), press [Esc+Ref+Pwr], and enter developer mode
    2. Enter [BadBr0ker](https://github.com/crosbreaker/badbr0ker?tab=readme-ov-file#i-have-a-usb-what-now)
